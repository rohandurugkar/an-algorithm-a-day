# an-algorithm-a-day
Practicing implementation of algorithms in JavaScript, at least one algorithm, everyday. Each algorithm has its own folder with an index.html file and a <algorithmName>.js file. Inputs to the algorithms are currently hard-coded in the .js files and the outputs are shown in the infamous JavaScript alert box (wherever possible).

I'm following Khan Academy's 'Algorithms' course and MIT's 'Introduction to Algorithms' lecture available on YouTube.
