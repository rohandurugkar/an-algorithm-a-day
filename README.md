# an-algorithm-a-day
Practicing implementation of algorithms in JavaScript, at least one algorithm, everyday. Each algorithm (unless specified) has its own folder with an index.html file and a <algorithmName>.js file. Inputs to the algorithms are currently hard-coded in the .js files and the outputs are shown in the infamous JavaScript alert box (wherever possible).
